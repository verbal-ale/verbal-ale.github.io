## RESTAURANT SERVICE DATA ENGINEERING
#### Mar 2025 - in progress
##### `Python, SQL, dbt, BigQuery`
**Practical Playground for Data Engineering**

In March 2025, after being invited to an interview for a data engineering position, I decided to gain more hands-on, practical experience in the field. Until then, my exposure had primarily come from the Big Data Management course in my master’s program, which, despite being a great introduction, was broad, theory-driven, and focused mainly on non-relational database systems.

To prepare for the interview, I began strengthening my `SQL` skills through online practice and self-study. I also explored `dbt` through its learning portal, and as a practical exercise, I built a simulated data pipeline in a domain I know well — hospitality.

This experience sparked this playground project where I continue to explore the ins and outs of building and maintaining a data pipeline.

## TOPIC MODEL VISUALISATIONS: A QUALITATIVE USER EVALUATION STUDY
#### Jan - Aug 2024
##### `D3.js, CSS, HTML, Python, Scikit-learn`
**Masters Project** and **Dissertation**.

In order to evaluate the usability of a projection-based topic modelling visualisation against a cluster-based one, I produced three interfaces for an experiment involving 22 participants.

All interfaces started as LDAvis dashboards, as my literature review showed it to be the most prominent tool used by researchers. I incorporated a BubbleTreemap in place of the projection mapping used by LDAvis to produce my second condition. I also made an interface with no topic-space encoding for training purposes. The topic modelling output used as input for the various dashboards is the same and is derived from fitting an LDA topic model to Scikit-learn's 20 Newsgroups dataset.

## SPOTIFY POPULARITY PREDICTION
#### Sep - Nov 2024 
##### `Python, Jupiter Notebook, Git`

In this group coursework, I worked in a team on a data mining and machine learning project using GitHub as our collaborative platform. The project covered various aspects of data mining and machine learning, including basic concepts, generative models, discriminative learning, and practical application of these techniques. My contribution consisted mainly of the inital data exploration and integration of datasets in the first phase of the project and covering the clustering requirement in the second phase.

## Realistic 3D Composition of a Refurbished House

My parents have this house in the country side, an hour and a half drive from where they live now. They want to refurbish it completely (it's a very old house) and eventually move there when they both retire. As I ahd Architectual 3D Design in university I decided to create a 3D model of the future building. I had my dad draw a couple of rough blueprints and put in the measurements of the house. From there me and my parents would have skype sessions now and again so they can have their input on what ot be done and give opinion on what has been done so far. 

### 26.02.2018
Completed building with tiled roof, some PVC windows
